# WebFTP

Start application with:
```bash
mix web_ftp.run "<path to server folder>"
```

If you are using linux, or git bash for Windows, you can use the `webftp_sample` shell script to start this program from wherever you want, without having to navigate to the project directory.

Built using Elixir 1.13.4 and Erland OTP 24, though it might work for older version too.
